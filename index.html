   <h3 class="text">Hello dear friend,
    I'm glad that you
    are
    interested
    in people like me, let me tell you
    briefly
    what I want in this application. I
    rushed
    from one place to another for a long
    time,
    but I always liked programming, I
    remember
    my attempts to write mods for GTA
    San-Andres. There is pawno language. I
    did
    pretty well. In general, I decided to
    quit
    my previous job and move into the world
    of programming.
