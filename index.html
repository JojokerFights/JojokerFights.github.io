					<p>How’s everyone’s learning journey going? I’m eager to hear about your achievements and challenges. I’d like to share a bit about my own journey. I was born in Ukraine, in a modest setting, and educated at a Jewish school. After completing the ninth grade, a door opened for me to move to Israel, a turning point in my life. My fascination with computers started early, not with gaming but with their inner workings and technology. Growing up in a financially constrained family meant I couldn’t fully explore this interest, but it never dampened my spirit. Perhaps, it’s why I’m here sharing my story instead of facing a much bleaker path that others in my situation might have. At 14, an opportunity arose to study in Israel, focusing on computer engineering through a program offered by Cisco. At first, I hardly knew the significance of Cisco, but those initial months were filled with awe and learning. After three fruitful years at what was affectionately known as a remarkable academy, I felt ready to take on the world, buoyed by pride from my family myself. However, life has a way of throwing curveballs. A distressing call informed me of a close relative’s passing, a profound loss that shook my world and halted my studies. I returned to Ukraine for three years, a period marked by reflection and eventually, a pivot to vocational training as a welder, aligning with the industrial opportunities in my hometown. This detour into a field far removed from IT seemed like settling, yet it was a step on my path. Fate, however, wasn’t done with me. An unexpected offer to return to Israel came, a serendipitous moment that felt like the universe’s way of nudging me back towards my passion for technology and computers. Now, at 26, my story is still unfolding, but I have some story continuity…</p>
